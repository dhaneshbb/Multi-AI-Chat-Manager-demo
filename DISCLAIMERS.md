# Disclaimers

## Educational Purpose Only

This Multi-AI Chat Manager Demo is provided for **educational and conceptual demonstration purposes only**. It is not intended for production use or actual implementation.

## AI Service Terms of Service

**IMPORTANT**: Users should respect the Terms of Service of all AI service providers.

### Recommended Approach

Instead of using browser automation or window management tools like this concept demonstrates, users should:

1. **Use Official APIs**: All major AI service providers offer official APIs for integration
   - OpenAI API for GPT models
   - Anthropic API for Claude
   - Google Cloud AI APIs
   - Microsoft Azure AI Services
   - Other provider-specific APIs

2. **Follow Terms of Service**: Each AI service provider has specific terms regarding:
   - Rate limits and usage quotas
   - Acceptable use policies
   - Integration guidelines
   - Commercial usage requirements

3. **Respect Provider Guidelines**: Browser automation may violate terms of service for many AI platforms

## Implementation Disclaimer

### What This Demo Does NOT Provide

- **No working software** or executable implementation
- **No encouragement** to violate AI service terms
- **No actual browser automation** or window management code
- **No circumvention tools** for service restrictions

### What This Demo IS

- **Educational concept** showcasing desktop application architecture
- **Documentation example** for technical writing
- **Learning resource** for software design principles

## Legal Compliance

Users implementing similar concepts should:

1. **Review Terms of Service** for each AI service before integration
2. **Use official APIs** provided by AI service companies
3. **Obtain proper licensing** for commercial applications
4. **Respect rate limits** and usage policies
5. **Follow platform guidelines** for integrations
