> **Important Notice**: This is a **documentation-only demo** showcasing the Multi-AI Chat Manager project concept. No executable code, proprietary assets, or third-party dependencies are included. See [Demo Limitations](docs/demo-limitations.md) and [Disclaimers](DISCLAIMERS.md) for complete details.

## Demo

## Overview

Multi-AI Chat Manager is a desktop application concept designed to streamline interactions with multiple AI chat services simultaneously. This tool manages browser-based AI applications, distributes prompts across services, and organizes workspace layouts for AI-powered conversations.

### Core Concept

Managing multiple AI chat interfaces becomes challenging when working on complex tasks that benefit from different AI perspectives. This project addresses that challenge by providing:

- **Unified Window Management**: Automatically detect, arrange, and control AI chat windows
- **Synchronized Prompt Distribution**: Send prompts to multiple AI services simultaneously
- **Window Layouts**: Grid and side-by-side arrangements for multi-AI workflows
- **Profile Management**: Support multiple user accounts per AI service
- **Desktop Integration**: Native OS integration with taskbar control and keyboard shortcuts

The User Interface (Electron) provides desktop controls and communicates with Window Management (Python) for core operations. The Python component handles browser window management and configuration while connecting to AI services running in web browsers.

### Key Features

**Window Management:**
- Automatically finds browser-based AI application windows using configurable patterns
- Arranges windows in grids or side-by-side layouts across multiple monitors
- Controls window states - minimize, restore, or close all AI application windows at once
- Brings specific AI services to the front when needed

**Prompt Distribution:**
- Selectable AI services for prompt delivery
- Uses clipboard to send text to active windows
- Batch operations for refreshing, closing, or restarting multiple sessions

**Configuration:**
- Uses YAML files for easy-to-read settings
- Changes apply immediately without restarting
- Supports multiple user accounts for each AI service
- Custom ordering for how windows get arranged

**Interface:**
- Clean desktop app built with Electron
- Dark and light themes available
- Shows real-time status of AI applications
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick actions
